# Portfolio_Page
This is my Portfolio Page.

## Acceptance Criteria

These are the  critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

#### * When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you:

I have completed this task by making a portfolio page which loads with my name as a logo on left side of navbar and my latest image in hero section and I have provided the buttons in navbar and made the multiple links throughout the website so, user can navigate through the page. Those buttons are fully working right now.

### * When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section:

I have provided the buttons which can be clicked to go into the specific section. When user clicks on them UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

### * When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications:

I have included the images of the specific projects in my work section. When user views the section about my specific work then he can also see the titled images of my applications.


### * When presented with your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others:

When user will hover over my application then that specific application box will change it's color and it will become larger for few seconds and other application boxes remain the smaller size.

### * When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

I haven't created any project like netflix clone etc. But I have put the real address of the sites so that when user clicks on the the application images the link takes them to the original website. I will put my own project links in future.

### * When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport:

I have made this website responsive. So, when the the screen size changes according to the device the layout of the website also gets changed.
